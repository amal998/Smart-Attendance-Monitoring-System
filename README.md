# Smart-Attendance-Monitoring-System

An automatic attendance management system aims at solv- ing the issues of manual methods of existing systems. We have used the concept of face recognition to implement a system that marks the attendance of a particular person by detecting and recognizing the face. These systems perform satisfactorily with different facial expressions, lighting and pose of the person. There is room for improvement since these systems sometimes fail to recognize every face student present in the classroom. We have made the device portable for easy use even when the sessions are on, without disturbing the class. There are future scopes to make a more compact ergonomics to make it a more user-friendly product to make an impact in building a more healthier academic environment.
